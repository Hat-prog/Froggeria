🎯 What requirements did you achieve?
I got all seven requiremenets working - useState and useEffect for managing the gallery state, components split up nicely, keyboard navigation with arrow keys, and alt text.

🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
Didn't get to the stretch goals like search functionality or using the Unsplash API.

🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
Nothing blocked me on the core requirements. Just didn't have time for the stretch goals.
